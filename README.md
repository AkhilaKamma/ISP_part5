**Project Topic:** Inventory and Supply Chain Management

The project aims to design and implement a distributed database system for efficient inventory and supply chain management. This system will enable real-time data updates and queries, optimizing inventory tracking, order processing, and supply chain operations.

## Database Structure

The tentative database structure includes tables for:
- Products
- Warehouses
- Suppliers
- Orders
- Shipments
- Inventory Levels

These tables will be interconnected to capture the flow of products throughout the supply chain.

## Plan of Action

### Part 1: Design and Implementation of a Distributed Database System

- **Tasks:** Design the database schema, select an appropriate distributed database management system (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and implement the distributed database.
- **Tools:** Apache Cassandra, DataStax Enterprise, Python for database implementation.
- **Expected Deliverables:** A distributed database system with the defined schema.

### Part 2: Fragmentation and Replication Techniques

- **Tasks:** Identify data fragmentation criteria (e.g., by product category or region) and implement data fragmentation. Set up data replication for fault tolerance.
- **Tools:** Cassandra's built-in support for data partitioning and replication.
- **Expected Deliverables:** Fragmented and replicated database with a clear strategy for data distribution.

### Part 3: Query Processing and Optimization Techniques

- **Tasks:** Implement query processing and optimization techniques to ensure fast and efficient data retrieval. Utilize Cassandra's query optimization features.
- **Tools:** Apache Cassandra's query language (CQL), query optimization tools.
- **Expected Deliverables:** Optimized queries for real-time inventory tracking and supply chain analysis.

### Part 4: Distributed Transaction Management

- **Tasks:** Develop a distributed transaction management system to handle inventory updates, order processing, and supply chain transactions. Implement distributed transaction protocols.
- **Tools:** Cassandra's support for lightweight transactions, Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination.
- **Expected Deliverables:** Reliable and consistent transaction management system.

### Part 5: Distributed NoSQL Database Systems Implementation

- **Tasks:** Integrate a NoSQL database system (e.g., Apache Cassandra) to store unstructured or semi-structured data related to inventory and supply chain events (e.g., sensor data, shipment tracking).
- **Tools:** Apache Cassandra for NoSQL data storage.
- **Expected Deliverables:** NoSQL data storage and retrieval capabilities integrated with the main database.

### Part 6: 3-Minute Video Demo

- **Tools:** Video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro), screen recording software (e.g., OBS Studio).
- **Other Details:** The video will provide a comprehensive overview of the distributed database system and its capabilities in managing inventory and supply chains efficiently.
